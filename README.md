# Chrome-Tone
A Chrome extension that uses randomly selected URLs from your open tabs to play back piano chords with unique rhythms and pitches.

Samples are provided, but you can populate the samples folder with any number of files. 

Use rename.py to rename your sample files into the correct format (1.wav - n.wav).

Then change the SAMPLES variable on line 2 in tonegenerator.js to reflect the number of files in the samples folder.

If you'd like to use .mp3 files, modify fileType on line 3 in rename.py and FILETYPE on line 3 in tonegenerator.js.

the 'TEMPO' and 'PITCHSHIFT' parameters can be adjusted to better fit the cadence and length of your custom samples. 


Enjoy!
